# Hey, I'm Pauline
Former Communication Officer with a knack for creative problem-solving :bulb:. Driven by a passion for Web Development :computer:, I transitioned into tech by self-learning Frontend Development and UX/UI Design through personal projects. To deepen my knowledge and enhance my teamwork skills, I joined a 7-month intensive bootcamp at BeCode. Now, I'm ready to bring my communication expertise, technical skills, and collaborative spirit to new projects and teams.
 
 I would like to contribute to open-source projects and create technology to make them more approachable, elevate people, and building communities.
